# Shopping Cart

The main goal of this project was to design a mock shopping cart where the user can select any items in the store to add to the shopping cart and view the shopping cart. The items in the store is taken from Fakestore API. The payment method is not implemented since this is a mock up of a web store. The <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart">project</a> is part of The Odin Project.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
